## CUB3D

## WHAT IS THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT?

The goal of the project is to create your own game by using an MLX library
and implement a graphical design of the legendary video game Wolfenstein 3D
(hence the name of the project) by using raycasting!

## CUB3D MANDATORY PART

For the mandatory part the task was to implement raycasting with different walls
when facing a different cardinal direction. Ceiling and floor are being drawn just
by the color stated in the map file.

## CUB3D BONUS PART

In the bonus part I have implemented sprites, textured drawing of wall and ceiling
as well as the possibility to draw a sky. Moreover, there is a possibility of adding
doors which can be opened during the interaction. Additionally, there is music when
the game is launched, though optimized for MacOS.
